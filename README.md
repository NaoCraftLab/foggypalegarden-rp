Resource Pack adds fog to the Pale Garden biome exactly as it appears in both vanilla and backporting mods.

---

This is a resource‑pack–based evolution of the [Foggy Pale Garden](https://modrinth.com/mod/foggypalegarden) mod, built on top of the capabilities provided by the [Polytone](https://modrinth.com/mod/polytone) and [Respackopts](https://modrinth.com/mod/respackopts) mods.

## ✨ Features

<details>
  <summary>🧠 Smart Fog in the Pale Garden Biome</summary>

The resource pack not only adds fog but also takes your convenience into account.

- 🪽 Fog dissipates when you fly over the biome above the cloud layer
- 🕳️ Fog dissipates when you descend into caves beneath the biome

</details>

<details>
  <summary>⏮️ Backport Support for “The Garden Awakens”</summary>

Fog is added to every biome named `pale_garden`, providing automatic compatibility with almost all Pale Garden backport mods.

Tested with:

- [Pale Garden Backport: The Garden Awakens](https://modrinth.com/mod/pale-garden-backport)
- [EarlyUpdate: Pale Garden](https://modrinth.com/mod/earlyupdate)
- [The Pale Garden](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-pale-garden)
- [Winter Drop Backport – Pale Garden](https://modrinth.com/mod/winter-drop-back-port-pale-garden)
- [I Want It Earlier 1.21.4 (Pale Garden)](https://modrinth.com/mod/i-want-it-earlier)
- [Pale Garden and Creaking](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pale-garden)
- [Pale Garden – Update](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/palegarden-update)

- [Bundles of Bravery (1.22)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bundles-of-bravery-1-22)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>🔧 Visual Settings & Localization</summary>

With the [Respackopts](https://modrinth.com/mod/respackopts) mod, you can adjust the fog settings and use built‑in presets directly
from this resource pack.

- `Radius` – how far the fog extends from the player
- `Fade` – smoothness of fog dissipation
- `Minimum Sky Light` – the sky brightness threshold below which fog clears (useful for caves and mines)
- `Maximum Height` – the highest altitude at which fog appears (lets you fly above the biome without entering fog)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>🎨 Fog Density Presets</summary>

In the pack’s settings you’ll find several ready‑to‑use presets with varying fog densities:

- `Ambient` – adds a light, atmospheric fog that doesn’t hinder movement
- `I Am Not Afraid, But...` – introduces a slightly denser fog
- `Stephen King` – a very thick fog that makes encountering a Creaking truly unexpected (just like in the novella *The Mist*)

</details>
